  <p>Avatar is my personal favorite show of all time. In my opinion, every person should watch the show when they have the time. Its characters, stories, and lessons have bought about a positive change in my life, and in a some aspects changed my outlook on life altogether. The world of the show is divided into four nations. The Water Nation, the Air Nation, the Earth Nation, and the Fire Nation. During the events of the show, the world has been under attack by the Fire Nation for a hundred years, whose goal has been to expand their empire to every corner of the world. Most of the nation's citizens can control the specific elements of their nation, and the Avatar is the only person who can control all four elements. It is his job to maintain the balance amongst the four nation, but he has been missing for a hundred years. But finally, he is discovered frozen in ice, and the show follows his journey with his friends in his quest to restore the balance once again.</p>
